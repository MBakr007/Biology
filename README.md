# Biology

this repository helps biologists manage and analyze their sequence data while storing it in a computer. 
you can convert DNA to RNA or RNA to DNA or RNA to Protein or DNA to Protein.


A DNA sequence can be of type (promoter, motif, tail, noncoding). Each DNA sequence consists of 2 strands, each strand is a string that is formed by the following 4 characters (nucleotides): A,C,G,T and each strand has its own direction (like 2-way street). 
 
 
The RNA sequence can be converted into a Protein sequence. Each 3 characters of the RNA sequence, called a codon, can be converted/mapped into one Protein character (called AminoAcid).


A DNA sequence can be converted to RNA sequence which is then converted to a Protein sequence
